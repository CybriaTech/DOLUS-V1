## How to save bookmarklets

To save them, do this:

<ol>
  <li>Copy the JS code</li>
  <li>Open New Tab</li>
  <li>In your web browser, create a new bookmark. This is often done by right-clicking the bookmarks bar and selecting "Add Page" or clicking the Star.</li>
  <li>Click Edit, Give it any name to separate from the other components.</li>
  <li>Below the URL Name input, replace the new tab link with the JS code</li>
  <li>Hit Save</li>
</ol>

## In A Test

If you wanna play safe, open the small frame, this will open a small iframe to Bing in the top left corner, to remove that frame. Click the Disable bookmarklet, though if you wanna play risky, you can use fullscreen (Disable can turn that off too!)

> ### If you disable it and it opens a Test Lock Warning, no biggie! It will disappear.
